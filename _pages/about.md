I am a postdoctoral research associate at the [Center for Theoretical and Computational Neuroscience](https://ctcn.wustl.edu/) at Washington University in St. Louis. I received a PhD in Psychology (Integrative Neuroscience) from the University of Chicago, advised by [Monica Rosenberg](https://cablab.uchicago.edu/) and [Yuan Chang Leong](https://mcnlab.uchicago.edu/). I received an MS in Biomedical Engineering and a BA in Psychology from Sungkyunkwan University in Korea.

I study how the human brain gives rise to the mind using functional neuroimaging and behavioral experiments. Nowadays, I am building computational models of the mind and brain to gain a mechanistic understanding. I am passionate about open and slow science practices and across-field collaborations.

## Research Program

**Large-scale neural dynamics and how they give rise to cognitive dynamics**<br/>
Cognition arises from neural operations at multiple [spatial scales](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2024.09.009), from individual neurons to [large-scale networks](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.85487). I study the brain at a macroscale using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to understand how dynamic interactions of the whole brain regions and networks collectively give rise to various cognitive processes and behavior. I use dynamical systems to characterize and model neural dynamics.

**Higher-order cognition: neurobiological and computational mechanisms**<br/>
I hope to understand the mechanisms of higher-order cognitive functions in humans. For this, in the past years, I have been studying memory-guided causal inference during naturalistic event comprehension. We understand everyday events by reasoning about their underlying [causes](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.03.12.642853v1). How does our brain integrate ongoing events with causally related past events to form and update coherent representation of everyday situations? I use naturalistic behavioral experiments, fMRI, and simulation of neural network models to answer this question. 

**Science in the wild**<br/>
I entered the field to understand the neural basis of subjective experience. I wanted to explain the tingling sensation I felt as a kid in front of a beautiful painting (so-called aesthetic experience). I collaborate with artists and organizations to conduct science in the wild to investigate our [subjective experiences](https://www.artsscienceculture.uchicago.edu/202223-grantees-1-1).<br/>
