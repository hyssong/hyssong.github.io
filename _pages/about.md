I am a postdoctoral research associate at the [Center for Theoretical and Computational Neuroscience](https://ctcn.wustl.edu/) at Washington University in St. Louis. I received a PhD in Psychology (Integrative Neuroscience) from the University of Chicago, advised by [Monica Rosenberg](https://cablab.uchicago.edu/) and [Yuan Chang Leong](https://mcnlab.uchicago.edu/). I received an MS in Biomedical Engineering and a BA in Psychology from Sungkyunkwan University in Korea.

I study how the human brain gives rise to the mind using functional neuroimaging and behavioral experiments. Nowadays, I am building computational models of the mind and brain to gain a mechanistic understanding. I am passionate about slow and open science practices and across-field collaborations.

## Research Program

**Large-scale neural dynamics and how they give rise to cognitive dynamics**<br/>
Cognition arises from neural operations at multiple [spatial scales](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2024.09.009), from individual neurons to [large-scale networks](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.85487). I study the brain at a macroscale using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to understand how dynamic interactions of the whole brain regions and networks collectively give rise to various cognitive processes and behavior. I use dynamical systems to characterize and model neural dynamics.

**High-order cognition**<br/>
I think a lot about our various higher-order cognitive processes and ways to understand their neural and computational underpinnings. I ask questions such as: How do we make [causal inferences](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.03.12.642853v1) to comprehend events? How do multiple experiences shape our preference and how do we use that to guide behavior? How do we make snap judgments about about other people but gradually update them over time? I use behavioral experiments, fMRI, and simulations of neural network models to answer these questions.

**Science in the wild**<br/>
I entered the field to understand the neural basis of subjective experience. I wanted to explain the tingling sensation I felt as a kid in front of a beautiful painting (so-called aesthetic experience). I collaborate with artists and organizations to conduct science in the wild to investigate our [subjective experiences](https://www.artsscienceculture.uchicago.edu/202223-grantees-1-1) and real-world behavior.<br/>
