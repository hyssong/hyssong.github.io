I am a postdoctoral research associate at the [Center for Theoretical and Computational Neuroscience](https://ctcn.wustl.edu/) at Washington University in St. Louis. I received a PhD in Psychology (Integrative Neuroscience) from the University of Chicago, advised by [Monica Rosenberg](https://cablab.uchicago.edu/) and [Yuan Chang Leong](https://mcnlab.uchicago.edu/). I received an MS in Biomedical Engineering and a BA in Psychology from Sungkyunkwan University in Korea.

I study how we make sense of everyday events by examining neural and computational underpinnings of memory and attention. I use naturalistic behavioral experiments and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study brain dynamics underlying memory and attention, and complement empirical findings with computational modeling, including simulations of artificial neural networks and dynamical systems. I am passionate about slow and open science practices and across-field collaborations.
