How do we make sense of events as they unfold in our daily lives? How do we make sense of others' behaviors and our own memories? My work asks how we comprehend narrative events by examining brain-wide dynamics and computations supporting this process. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, naturalistic behavioral experiments, and computational modeling, my work investigates various cognitive processes integral to narrative comprehension, including causal reasoning, episodic memory, and attentional engagement. The goal of my research is to better understand our rich and dynamic mental experiences by understanding the brain's operations.

I am an incoming postdoctoral research fellow at the [Center for Theoretical and Computational Neuroscience](https://ctcn.wustl.edu/) at Washington University in St. Louis. I received a PhD from the University of Chicago, working with [Monica Rosenberg](https://cablab.uchicago.edu/) and [Yuan Chang Leong](https://mcnlab.uchicago.edu/). I received a BA and MS from Sungkyunkwan University in Korea, working with [Won Mok Shim](http://wshimlab.com/) and [Min-Suk Kang](https://sites.google.com/view/vcnlskku/vcnl-lab).

I am passionate about open and slow science practices and across-field collaborations.
