How do we make sense of events as they unfold in our daily lives? How do we make sense of others' behaviors and our own memories? My work asks how we comprehend narrative events by examining the underlying brain-wide dynamics and computations supporting this process. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, naturalistic behavioral experiments, and computational modeling, my work investigates various cognitive processes integral to narrative comprehension, including causal reasoning, episodic memory, and attentional engagement. The aim of my research is to understand neural mechanisms that support our rich and dynamic cognitive experiences.

I am an incoming postdoctoral research fellow at the [Center for Theoretical and Computational Neuroscience](https://ctcn.wustl.edu/) at Washington University in St. Louis. I received a PhD from the University of Chicago and a BA and MS from Sungkyunkwan University in Korea.

I am passionate about open science and across-field collaborations.
