I study how we comprehend narratives and the underlying brain-wide dynamics and computations that support the process. Using functional neuroimaging, behavioral experiments, and computational modeling, my work investigates various cognitive processes in narrative comprehension, including causal reasoning, episodic memory, and attentional engagement. The goal of my research is to understand our rich and dynamic cognitive experiences by uncovering their neural mechanisms.

I received a PhD from the University of Chicago, working with [Monica Rosenberg](https://cablab.uchicago.edu/) and [Yuan Chang Leong](https://mcnlab.uchicago.edu/). I am an incoming postdoctoral research fellow at the [Center for Theoretical and Computational Neuroscience](https://ctcn.wustl.edu/) at Washington University in St. Louis. I am passionate about open science and across-field collaborations.
