Hi, thanks for visiting!
<br/>
I am a cognitive neuroscientist studying how the brain works. I conduct naturalistic behavioral experiments during functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine brain-wide activity and interaction dynamics. I develop computational models to simulate cognitive processes and the underlying brain circuits. The goal is to understand how the human brain gives rise to cognitive experiences and everyday behavior. I am passionate about slow and open science practices and across-field collaborations.

I am currently a postdoctoral research associate at the [Center for Theoretical and Computational Neuroscience](https://ctcn.wustl.edu/) at Washington University in St. Louis, where I mainly work with [ShiNung Ching](https://braindynamics.engineering.wustl.edu/) and [Zach Reagh](https://sites.wustl.edu/complexmemlab/). I received a PhD in Psychology (Integrative Neuroscience) from the University of Chicago, advised by [Monica Rosenberg](https://cablab.uchicago.edu/) and [Yuan Chang Leong](https://mcnlab.uchicago.edu/). I received an MS in Biomedical Engineering and a BA in Psychology from Sungkyunkwan University in Korea, advised by [Won Mok Shim](https://www.wshimlab.com/) and [Min-Suk Kang](https://sites.google.com/view/vcnlskku/vcnl-lab).
