**Narrative comprehension and multiscale brain dynamics**<br/>
How do we make sense of events as they unfold in our daily lives? My work asks how we comprehend narrative events by examining brain dynamics at multiple spatiotemporal scales. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and naturalistic behavioral experiments, my work investigates various cognitive processes integral to [narrative comprehension](https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0037-21.2021), including causal reasoning, episodic memory, [emotion](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.11.14.566767v2), and [attentional engagement](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2021905118). I think a lot about the brain at multiple [spatiotemporal scales](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.85487), ranging from local to global spatial scales and fast to slow time scales.

**Computational model of the brain on causal reasoning**<br/>
Comprehension is achieved by piecing together causally related events in memory to form a coherent representation of the situation. How does the brain do this? Is there a way to create a computational model of the brain that achieves such complex causal reasoning? Seminal work in computational neuroscience has focused on relatively simple cognitive tasks that are well-parameterized. I think a lot about how to expand this to naturalistic paradigms to gain a mechanistic understanding of complex cognitive processes such as causal reasoning during comprehension.

**Science and art**<br/>
I entered the field to understand the neural basis of subjective experience. I wanted to understand and explain the tingling sensation I felt as a child in front of a beautiful painting (so-called aesthetic experience). My research aims to collaborate with artists and organizations to conduct science in the wild to investigate our subjective experiences. [Here](https://yukyeomkim.com/Eye-Contact) is my recent collaboration with a robotic artist, where we conducted a behavioral study as visitors interact with eye-following and eye-avoiding robots in the gallery.

I am an incoming postdoctoral research fellow at the [Center for Theoretical and Computational Neuroscience](https://ctcn.wustl.edu/) at Washington University in St. Louis. I received a PhD in Psychology (Integrative Neuroscience) from the University of Chicago, working with [Monica Rosenberg](https://cablab.uchicago.edu/) and [Yuan Chang Leong](https://mcnlab.uchicago.edu/). I received a BA in Psychology and MS in Biomedical Engineering from Sungkyunkwan University in Korea, working with [Won Mok Shim](http://wshimlab.com/) and [Min-Suk Kang](https://sites.google.com/view/vcnlskku/vcnl-lab).

I am passionate about open and slow science practices and across-field collaborations.
