I am a [postdoctoral research associate](https://neuroscience.wustl.edu/hayoung-song-to-join-washu-as-ctcn-fellow/) at the [Center for Theoretical and Computational Neuroscience](https://ctcn.wustl.edu/) at Washington University in St. Louis. I received a PhD in Psychology (Integrative Neuroscience) from the University of Chicago, working with [Monica Rosenberg](https://cablab.uchicago.edu/) and [Yuan Chang Leong](https://mcnlab.uchicago.edu/). I received a BA in Psychology and MS in Biomedical Engineering from Sungkyunkwan University in Korea, working with [Won Mok Shim](http://wshimlab.com/) and [Min-Suk Kang](https://sites.google.com/view/vcnlskku/vcnl-lab).

I am passionate about open and slow science practices and across-field collaborations.

## Research Program

**Causal inference during naturalistic event comprehension**<br/>
We understand everyday events by reasoning about their underlying [causes](https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0037-21.2021). We integrate ongoing events with causally related events in memory to form and update coherent situational representations. How does the brain accomplish this? I use functional magnetic resonance imaging, naturalistic behavioral experiments, and computational modeling to answer this question. 

**Neural dynamics at multiple scales**<br/>
Cognition arises from neural operations at multiple [spatial scales](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2024.09.009), from individual neurons to [large-scale networks](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.85487). I think a lot about how neural operations at different scales collectively give rise to complex behavior, and how we can study this as a field. I use dynamical systems to characterize and model neural dynamics.

**Science in the wild**<br/>
I entered the field to understand the neural basis of subjective experience. I wanted to explain the tingling sensation I felt as a kid in front of a beautiful painting (so-called aesthetic experience). I collaborate with artists and organizations to conduct science in the wild to investigate our [subjective experiences](https://www.artsscienceculture.uchicago.edu/202223-grantees-1-1).<br/>
