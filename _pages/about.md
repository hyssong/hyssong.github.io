I am a [postdoctoral research associate](https://neuroscience.wustl.edu/hayoung-song-to-join-washu-as-ctcn-fellow/) at the [Center for Theoretical and Computational Neuroscience](https://ctcn.wustl.edu/) at Washington University in St. Louis. I received a PhD in Psychology (Integrative Neuroscience) from the University of Chicago, working with [Monica Rosenberg](https://cablab.uchicago.edu/) and [Yuan Chang Leong](https://mcnlab.uchicago.edu/). I received a BA in Psychology and MS in Biomedical Engineering from Sungkyunkwan University in Korea, working with [Won Mok Shim](http://wshimlab.com/) and [Min-Suk Kang](https://sites.google.com/view/vcnlskku/vcnl-lab).

<br/>
I am passionate about open and slow science practices and across-field collaborations.

## Research Program

**Event comprehension**<br/>
Comprehension involves integrating ongoing events with causally related events in memory to form and update a coherent situational representation. How does the brain accomplish this? Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, naturalistic behavioral experiments, and computational modeling, my work investigates various cognitive processes integral to narrative comprehension, including [causal reasoning](https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0037-21.2021), episodic memory (stay tuned!), [attentional engagement](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2021905118) and [emotion](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.11.14.566767v2).

**Multiscale neural operation**<br/>
Cognition arises from neural operations at multiple [spatial scales](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.85487), from individual neurons to large-scale networks. How do neural operations at different scales collectively give rise to complex behavior, and how can we study this as a field? Stay tuned for an opinion piece that I worked on recently with [JeongJun Park](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-ATBHAIAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [Monica Rosenberg](https://cablab.uchicago.edu/), covering a wide range of work in behaving rodents, non-human primates, and humans!

**Science and art**<br/>
I entered the field to understand the neural basis of subjective experience. I wanted to explain the tingling sensation I felt as a kid in front of a beautiful painting (so-called aesthetic experience). I collaborate with artists and organizations to conduct science in the wild to investigate our [subjective experiences](https://www.artsscienceculture.uchicago.edu/202223-grantees-1-1).<br/>
